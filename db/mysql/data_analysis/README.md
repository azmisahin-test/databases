# Data Insights

The `data_insights` directory is designed to support data analysis and insights generation from the data stored in the database. This directory may include analysis scripts, reports, and tools to facilitate data exploration.

## Structure

- **Analysis Scripts**: Contains scripts used to perform data analysis and generate insights from the database. These scripts are typically written in Python or SQL and are designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data for reporting purposes.

- **Reports**: This folder may include generated reports or dashboards that summarize key metrics and findings from the data analysis process. Reports can be in various formats, including CSV, JSON, or visualization formats (e.g., charts, graphs).

- **Tools**: Includes any additional tools or utilities that support data analysis, such as data visualization libraries or frameworks.

## Usage

To perform data analysis, run the relevant scripts in this directory. Ensure that the database is up to date with the latest data before executing any analysis. Check the individual script documentation for specific usage instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `data_insights` are welcome. Please follow the project guidelines for submitting scripts and reports, and ensure that any new analysis adheres to the established data practices.
